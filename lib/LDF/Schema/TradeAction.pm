<p>The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to
PriceSpecification and its subtypes.</p> <p>Usage guidelines:</p> <ul>
<li>Use the <a class="localLink"

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes">ISO 4217
codes</a> e.g. "USD") instead of including <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign#Currencies_that_use_the_doll
ar_or_peso_sign">ambiguous symbols</a> such as '$' in the value.</li>
<li>Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a
decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.</li>
<li>Note that both <a

RDFa</a> and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for
publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly
formatting.</li> <li>Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO'
(U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar
Unicode symbols.</li> </ul>
